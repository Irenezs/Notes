# Quarks
## Smaller Scattering
In 1968, a group of physicists conducted an experiment to Rutherford's gold foil experiment, but on nucleons, with a beam of electrons. This yielded similar results, such as deflections of varying angles, proving that nucleons were made of something smaller, which came to be known as quarks, currently accepted to be the smallest indivisible particle.

## Quarks
There are 6 different quarks, although this course only cares about 3:
up: u, down: d, and strange: s. Their properties are below:
Quark|Charge|Baryon Number|Strangeness
---|---|---|---
u|+2/3|+1/3|0
d|-1/3|+1/3|0
s|-1/3|+1/3|-1
Each quark has a counterpart; anti-quarks have essentially the same properties, but just reversed, so anti-up has a charge of -2/3, for example.

Quarks cannot be on their own, due to their fractional properties. 

Quark-based particles are called [[#Hadrons|hadrons]], which can be broken into two separate groups: [[#Mesons|mesons]], containing a quark and antiquark, and [[#Baryons|baryons]], containing 3 quarks or 3 antiquarks.

# Hadrons
## Mesons
- quark / anti-quark pair
- 8 needed to memorise for the course

Meson|Symbol|Quarks|Charge|Strangeness
---|---|---|---|---
Pion +|$\pi^+$|$u\overline{d}$|+1|0
Pion -|$\pi^-$|$\overline{u}d$|-1|0
Pion 0|$\pi^0$|$d\overline{d}$|0|0
Anti-Pion 0|$\pi^0$|$u\overline{u}$|0|0
Kaon +|$K^+$|$u\overline{s}$|+1|+1
Kaon -|$K^-$|$\overline{u}s$|-1|-1
Kaon 0|$K^0$|$d\overline{s}$|0|+1
Anti-Kaon 0|$\overline{K}^0$|$\overline{d}s$|0|-1

## Baryons
- 3 quarks OR 3 anti-quarks
- 4 needed to know for course

Baryon|Symbol|Quarks|Charge|Strangeness|Baryon Number
---|---|---|---|---|---
proton|$p$|$uud$|+1|0|+1
neutron|$n$|$udd$|0|0|+1
anti-proton|$\overline{p}$|$\overline{uud}$|-1|0|-1
anti-neutron|$\overline{n}$|$\overline{udd}$|0|0|-1

## Basics
When light of high enough energy^[1] is incident on a metal plate, it was observed that electrons were released from the surface of the plate. When the intensity of light was increased, the number of electrons emitted increased.
