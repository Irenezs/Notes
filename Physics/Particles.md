# Quarks
## Smaller Scattering
In 1968, a group of physicists conducted an experiment to Rutherford's gold foil experiment, but on nucleons, with a beam of electrons. This yielded similar results, such as deflections of varying angles, proving that nucleons were made of something smaller, which came to be known as quarks, currently accepted to be the smallest indivisible particle.

## Quarks
There are 6 different quarks, although this course only cares about 3:
up: u, down: d, and strange: s. Their properties are below:
Quark|Charge|Baryon Number|Strangeness
---|---|---|---
u|+2/3|+1/3|0
d|-1/3|+1/3|0
s|-1/3|+1/3|-1
Each quark has a counterpart; anti-quarks have essentially the same properties, but just reversed, so anti-up has a charge of -2/3, for example.

Quarks cannot be on their own, due to their fractional properties. 

Quark-based particles are called hadrons, which can be broken into two separate groups: mesons, containing a quark and antiquark, and baryons, containing 3 quarks or 3 antiquarks.
