			- $\Delta W = F\Delta s$ so area beneath graph is work done or energy used to compress. The energy used is stored in the spring as elastic potential. By using the area of a triangle, $\frac{1}{2}(l\times w)$, we find the energy stored, $E=\frac{1}{2}Fe$.

	- When two waves travel in opposite directions, and have the same frequency, they will superpose together, which will cause a standing wave.
	- There are 4 nodes and 3 antinodes, where there is no amplitude and maximum amplitude respectively.
	- There is a $\lambda$ of 0.80m
	- Waves reflect off of clamp and interfere with waves coming from oscillator
	- Energy is not transferred along the string
