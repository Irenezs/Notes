		- A photon has energy of $E=hf$, and therefore the Energy of a photon is directly linked to the photon frequency. When the light is incident on a metal plate, each photon is absorbed by an electron, where some of the energy of the photon is used to break from the surface, otherwise known as the work function $\phi$. If there is any more energy in the photon, it is stored as kinetic energy. From these facts, we can deduce an equation for this: $$E_k=hf-\phi$$The reason the emitted electrons have a range of kinetic energies is due to the work function, depending on the depth of the electron it will take more work to bring it to the surface to be emitted.
