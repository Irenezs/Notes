# Resolving Forces

# Friction
Friction acts to oppose motion on rough surfaces.
The formula for friction is as follows: $$F_r\le \mu R$$
Friction will only give as much force as is necessary to oppose motion until it cannot provide more resistance, where its max is $\mu R$, at which point the motive force will begin moving the object.


# Slopes
When dealing with objects on slopes, it is important to resolve all forces parallel and perpendicular to the slope, as to make it so much easier.

On a slope, gravity is $mg\sin\alpha$ $\parallel$ to the slope and $mg\cos\alpha$ $\perp$ to the slope.
