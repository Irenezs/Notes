At they're essence, logarithms are the inverse of indices, covered in [[M1 Surds and Indices]]. The usage of a logarithm (log henceforth) is as thus: $$\log_ny=x \iff y=n^x$$
It should be noted here that the logarithm of a number cannot be negative, otherwise the log will return a complex number. This is clear, because of a log's index form $y=n^x$, you cannot raise any $n$ to some $x$ that will return a negative number, when the inputs are all real.

In maths, shortcuts are often used, which is also true in logs. $\log_{10}$ is often just called $\log$, and $\log_e$ is written as $\ln$.

# The Laws
$$\log_aA+\log_aB=\log_aAB$$$$\log_aA-\log_aB=\log_a{\frac{A}{B}}$$$$\log_ax^n=n\log_ax$$
These 3 log laws are needed to be learnt for the course, and are not given to you in a formula sheet.
