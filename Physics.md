		- The strong nuclear force holds the nucleus together. It only acts on hadrons, so the muon cannot be the particle responsible for this force. The Rest Energy range is from 0.51-470MeV, so the Kaon cannot be the particle, as it has a rest energy of 490MeV. Thus, the only possible particle in this list is the pion, as it has a rest energy in the range and is a hadron.

		- To pull an electron from the surface of the metal, the photon must be of higher energy than the metal's work function. The  energy of a photon is directly proportional to its frequency, therefore there is a minimum frequency for the photoelectric effect to happen

		- The number of photoelectrons emitted depends on the intensity of the incident photons. The constant current is reached when all photoelectrons released reach the anode.

		- The electrons must pass through an electric field that is opposing their motion. Thus, as the pd increases, the field strength increases, so the electrons are pushed back towards the plate with more force, which their max $E_k$ cannot overcome.

		- The stopping potential will increase, as it is related to the maximum kinetic energy of the electrons. The maximum kinetic energy of the electrons increases as the energy from the photons has to use less energy to overcome the work function.

		- They are connected to the same signal generator, so their frequency and phase difference will be the same

		- The sound wave superpose, at A and B the waves are in phase, meaning they produce a maximum. Moving from A introduces a path difference, so they superpose destructively, leading to a lower amplitude.

		- The wavelength will gradually increase. So the path difference at C will get closer to one wavelength, so the sound will get louder as the waves move into phase.
