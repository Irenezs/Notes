A beaker contains a thermometer and the thermistor. Heat the water first in a water bath to 100$^\circ$C, then add the water to the beaker, being careful to not burn yourself with the water. Stir to equalise the temperature in the beaker. Take readings off of the voltmeter and ammeter, and the thermometer at some interval, probably 5 or 10$^\circ$C. To cool down the water quicker, ice can be stirred in to quickly drop the temperature. Repeat this heating and cooling process thrice and average the results. Resistance is calculated by $R=\frac{V}{I}$. Plot resistance against temperature, with temperature on x and resistance on y, drawing a line of best fit.

The precision of instruments could be improved by using higher resolution components, and using a temperature probe and data logger.
