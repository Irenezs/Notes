An ideal gas is a gas that follows all the gas laws at all temperatures and pressures.
There are 8 assumptions used when modelling an ideal gas:
- A large number
- of identical molecules,
- considered to be point masses,
- moving with random motion
- where collisions happen instantaneously
- and elastically.
- All of Newton's laws are followed,
- and no intermolecular forces are felt.
Pressure is exerted by a gas on a container by collisions of the gas particles and the container walls, where the rate of change of momentum (A force) is applied over the surface of the container (A surface area). This works as $P=\frac{F}{A}$.

Boyle's law is where $P\propto\frac{1}{V}$, for a constant temperature (and mass of gas). As there is a constant temperature, there is a constant $(\overline{c_{rms}})^2$. This is as increasing the volume  means the molecules travel further between collisions, so a lower rate of change in momentum, thus a lower pressure. See paper for graph.

Charles' law is where $V\propto T$, for a constant pressure (and mass of gas). As there is constant pressure, the collisions per second is constant, so increasing the temperature increases the $(\overline{c_{rms}})^2$, so particles need to travel further before colliding, so volume increases. See paper for graph.
