The object to be weighed will be placed in the basket, and the counterweight would be moved along the beam until the beam is horizontal. This can be ensured with some form of spirit level. Then, to find the mass of the object, we calculate the moments of each object from the pivot, done by force x perpendicular distance from the pivot to line of action of the force. 

Due to the principle of moments, as the beam is in equilibrium, the moment o
