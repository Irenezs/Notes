Forces|Gravitational|Electromagnetic|Weak Nuclear|Strong Nuclear
---|---|---|---|---
Acts on|Massive Particles|Charged Particles|All Particles|Hadrons/Quarks
Range|$\infty$|$\infty$|~$1am$|Repulsive $0-0.5fm$, Attractive $0.5-3fm$
Relative Strength|$10^{-43}$|$10^{-2}$|$10^{-6}$|$1$
Exchange Particle(s)|graviton|virtual photon ($\gamma$)|$W^+,W^-$|gluon ($g$), pion ($\pi^0$)

The heavier the exchange particle is, the shorter the range of the force, so the photon and graviton will have no mass. This is as the larger a particle is, the greater energy is required to be "borrowed" from the universe without energy being created.

Feynman diagrams are straight lined diagrams that show the interactions in a whole reaction, where time is usually the y axis. Exchange particles are depicted with a wavy line.
