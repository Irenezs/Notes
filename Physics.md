		- There is a rate of change in momentum, so there is a force acting on the air. Therefore the air exerts a force on the engine of the same magnitude but the opposite direction

		- Momentum is a vector, therefore has a direction. The direction of the air has changed, therefore the momentum of the air changes.

		- B should be used for a lift cable. This is as it has a high breaking stress, and YM. All other materials rejected in part due to lower breaking stresses.
		- D should be chosen for a bungee cord. This is as it can store a large amount of energy before failure. Not A as it is b
