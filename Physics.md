		- The high potential difference causes the gas atoms to ionise, the positive ions are accelerated towards C, while electrons accelerate toward B, and will pass through the hole in the anode.

		- When the path is straight, the Electric Force is equal to the Magnetic Force. $EQ=BQv\implies v=\frac E B$. Therefore, increase E or decrease B to increase v.

		- Thomson's result was 1000x bigger than the ion with the largest specific charge known at the time (hydrogen ion), thus from this, he could conclude the charge was much greater on the electron or the mass is much smaller.

		- Energy is quantized, meaning it is transferred in fundamental units, like charge cannot be lower than 1e. $E=hf$.
