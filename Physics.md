		- There is a rate of change in momentum, so there is a force acting on the air. Therefore the air exerts a force on the engine of the same magnitude but the opposite direction

		- Momentum is a vector, therefore has a direction. The direction of the air has changed, therefore the momentum of the air changes.

		- B should be used for a lift cable. This is as it has a high breaking stress, and YM. All other materials rejected in part due to lower breaking stresses.
		- D should be chosen for a bungee cord. This is as it can store a large amount of energy before failure. Not A as it is brittle.

		- The voltmeter is measuring the relative potential difference between the paths in parallel, the internal resistance can be considered to be on both paths and therefore will not affect the relative potential difference.

		- There is a one-one relationship between photons and photoelectrons, meaning if a photon's energy is not high enough the electron does not escape the surface of the metal, called its work function. The energy of a photon is directly proportional to its frequency. Thus, current only flows above a threshold frequency.

		- The number of electrons emitted increases, and as current is rate of flow of charge, current increases.

		- The stopping potential would be greater, as the max $E_k$ would be greater, as the $E_{k(max)}=hf-\phi$, and energy of the photons is being increased.

		- An isotope is an element with the same atomic number (Z number) but a different nucleon number (A number). This means it has a different number of neutrons but same number of protons to another atom.

		- This is to conserve momentum after the collision, so two photons of opposite direction created.
