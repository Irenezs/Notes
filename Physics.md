The object to be weighed will be placed in the basket, and the counterweight would be moved along the beam until the beam is horizontal. This can be ensured with some form of spirit level. Then, to find the mass of the object, we calculate the moments of each object from the pivot, done by force x perpendicular distance from the pivot to line of action of the force. 

Due to the principle of moments, as the beam is in equilibrium, the moment of the weighed object and counterweight are equal, as they create opposite moments. The weight of the object is found by:
$$W_O=\frac{D_CW_C}{D_O}$$
Where $W_O$ is the weight you are calculating, $D_C$ is the distance from the pivot to counterweight, $W_C$ is the weight of the counterweight, and $D_O$ is the distance from the object to pivot.

==Calibration is using known masses to verify if the counterweight gives the correct results.==
To measure greater masses, you could use a heavier counterweight. This is applicable as both clockwise and anticlockwise moments will be higher, if both object and counterweight are heavier.

The precision can be improved by using smaller scale divisions. ==and a thinner string/wire==
