An ideal gas is a gas that follows all the gas laws at all temperatures and pressures.
There are 8 assumptions used when modelling an ideal gas:
- A large number
- of identical molecules,
- considered to be point masses,
- moving with random motion
- where collisions happen instantaneously
- and elastically.
- All of Newton's laws are followed,
- and no intermolecular forces are felt.
Pressure is exerted by a gas on a container by collisions of the gas particles and the container walls, where the rate of change of momentum (A force) is applied over the surface of the container (A surface area). This works as $P=\frac{F}{A}$.

Boyle's law is where $P\propto\frac{1}{V}$, for a constant temperature (and mass of gas).
