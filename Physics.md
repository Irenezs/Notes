A single ray of light is sent through a block at different angles, and the corresponding angle of refraction is measured using a protractor from the normal. The interval of angles should be between 0$^\circ$ and $\theta_c$. Be careful to not burn yourself of the bulb.

For each incident angle the refracted angle is measured at least 3 times to calculate the mean and remove anomalous, this reduces random error.

The refractive index is calculated as $n=\frac{\sin{\theta_1}}{\sin{\theta_2}}$, and critical angle as $\sin{\theta_c}=\frac{1}{n}$. By plotting $\sin{\theta_1}$ against $\sin{\thea}
