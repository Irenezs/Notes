Centripetal force is the force that makes objects move in circular motion, and it always points towards the centre of the circle. 
Centripetal force can be provided by gravity, tension, friction, and magnetism.
$$F_C = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$
Centripetal force is affected by the mass $m$, speed $v$, and radius (of the circle) $r$, calculated in the formula above, so increasing the mass increases the centripetal force directly proportionally. centripetal force is directly proportional to speed squared, and inversely proportional to radius of the circle.

The tension will be at a maximum when the string is directly down, and at a minimum when pointed up. at the bottom, $T= \frac{mv^2}{r} + mg$. at the top, $T= \frac{mv^2}{r} -mg$. at the sides, $T=\frac{mv^2}{r}$.
