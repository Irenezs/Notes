An object is undergoing simple harmonic motion if it is oscillating about a fixed equilibrium point. The acceleration of the object is proportional to the displacement from the equilibrium point and in the opposite direction.

The total Energy in a system is constant in an undamped system, otherwise energy is transferred to the surroundings.

The time period of oscillations can be measured by pulling the pendulum back no more than 10 degrees, releasing it and stopping when it has passed a fiducial mark. The accuracy can be improved by recording 10 oscillations at a time and dividing the final time by 10, this reduces the effect of human reaction time on the result.

When the driving frequency is the same as the natural frequency, resonance will occur and the amplitude will increase. The natural frequency is found by 1/T.
