		- The strong nuclear force keeps the nucleons together. It only acts on hadrons, and has a short range at ~3fm.

		- In alpha decay, baryon number is conserved by the 4 nucleons leaving the nucleus as another particle, but they are not modified. (daughter nucleons total parent nucleons)
		- In beta decay, baryon number is conserved as a neutron changes into a proton or vice versa, and so the baryon number is unchanged. Additionally, the electron and electron antineutrino, or positron and electron neutrino are leptons, and do not affect the baryon number.

		- Results must be independently checked before they can be confirmed. The machinery required in particle physics is very expensive and so collaboration allows for this cost to be reduced per party.

		- The acceleration in Figure 1 is constant, in Figure 2 the acceleration is greatest at the start of the ramp, before decreasing to 0 at C.

		- the change in gravitational potential energy was the same, therefore the change in kinetic energy was the same.
