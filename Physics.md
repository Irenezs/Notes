The equation for emf is $\varepsilon=V+Ir$, which can be rearranged to $V=-rI+\varepsilon$. This shows what is necessary to work out emf and internal resistance, Voltage and Current. To change the V and I, you will change the value of the variable resistor, and take 5-10 readings of V and I. The battery must be switched off during the ch
