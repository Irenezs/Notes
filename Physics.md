The equation for emf is $\varepsilon=V+Ir$, which can be rearranged to $V=-rI+\varepsilon$. This shows what is necessary to work out emf and internal resistance, Voltage and Current. To change the V and I, you will change the value of the variable resistor, and take 5-10 readings of V and I. The battery must be switched off during the changing of the resistor, as it will change the emf otherwise.

Measure the voltage and current thrice for every value of R. By averaging and ignoring anomalous, you can reduce random error in the experiment.

The voltage is plotted against the current on a VI graph, with a line of best fit drawn, and extrapolated to the y-intercept. The emf is the y-intercept, and the gradient of the line is -internal resistance.

The precision of this experiment can be improved by using an electronic probe, and data logger. The values of emf and internal resistance could be more precise by having smaller scale divisions on the graph, or using a computer to draw the graph.
