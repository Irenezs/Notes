A beaker contains a thermometer and the thermistor. Heat the water first in a water bath to 100$^\circ$C, then add the water to the beaker, being careful to not burn yourself with the water. Stir to equalise the temperature in the beaker. Take readings off of the voltmeter and ammeter, and the thermometer at some interval, probably 5 or 10$^\circ$C. To cool down the water quicker, ice can be stirred in to quickly drop the temperature. Repeat this heating and cooling process thrice and average the results. Resistance is calculated by $R=\frac{V}{I}$. Plot resistance against temperature, with temperature on x and resistance on y, drawing a line of best fit.

The precision of instruments could be improved by using higher resolution components, and using a temperature probe and data logger.

Kirchhoff's $1^{st}$ Law:
- The total current flowing into a junction is equal to the total current flowing out.
Kirchhoff's $2^{nd}$ Law:
- The sum of all emfs is equal to the sum of all pds

Diagram 1:
As R increases, this becomes a larger percentage of the total resistance, so has a higher pd, so the speaker will get quieter.
Diagram 2:
The thermistor increases in resistance so has a bigger percentage of the resistance, therefore the heater drops in pd, thus getting cooler.
Diagram 3:
The LDR gets a larger percentage of the resistance, thus the lamp gets a smaller pd, so drops in brightness
