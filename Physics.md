A hadron is a particle made up of quarks and antiquarks. Some examples are protons, pions, and kaons. A lepton is a fundamental particle, It cannot be divided further into smaller parts. There are only six: electron, muon, taon, electron neutrino, muon neutrino, taon neutrino.

Both groups experience the weak nuclear force, gravity, and the electromagnetic force. The only group that is affected by the strong nuclear force is the hadrons.

Hadrons may be subdivided into Mesons and Baryons, where mesons are built up as a $q\overline{q}$ pair ==(An anti-meson is described as being made of the opposite quark-antiquark pair.)== and baryons built as a $qqq$ triple. (Anti-baryons are built as $\overline{q}\overline{q}\overline{q}$.)
Anti-particles are described as having the opposite quantum states of the original particle.
