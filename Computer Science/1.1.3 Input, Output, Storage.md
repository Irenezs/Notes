# Input / Output
## Definitions
- Input Device – A device that communicates information from the real world to binary data, examples being microphones, cameras, etc. 
- Output Device – A device that translates binary data into information a human can read and parse, such as a monitor, speaker, or haptic motor in a controller.

These devices are crucial in our interaction with computers, from ATMs to consoles. We need input devices to be able to give details to ATMs, give controls to games, or answer tests. Output devices are necessary to display the processed data, which can be visual, audio, haptic, or any number of other outputs. 

# Storage

Storage is used to hold data while the computer is turned off. The three types of storage are:
- Magnetic – Bits determined by magnetic compound polarisation 
- Flash – Bits determined by flow of electricity through oxide layers 
- Optical – Bits determined by pits burned into the medium.

Media|Capacity|Speed|Portability|Durability|Reliability|Cost
---|---|---|---|---|---|---
Optical|3|3|2|2|3|2
Magnetic|1|2|3|3|2|1
Flash|2|1|1|1|1|3
Examples: 

- Magnetic storage is likely to be used in backups, as they need lots of data stored and don’t need quick access to files. 
- Optical is likely to be used in distribution of video games or other software, due to its cheapness to be produced and its low weight.
- Flash is likely to be used in cases where there is moderate size needs but needs fast access to data stored.
