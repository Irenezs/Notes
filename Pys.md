- 31ai ==2/2
	- In Paper
- 31aii ==1/1
	- Reverse the connection to the power supply
- 31bi ==2/2
	- Plot a graph of voltages and current values, then divide V by I from the graph. Take multiple readings from the graph to see how R varies.
- 31bii ==1/1
	- It would decrease.
- 20a ==1/1
	- A component with constant resistance
- 2bi ==2/2
	- In Paper
- 2bii ==5/6
	- Use a variable power supply to change the voltage, use a voltmeter and ammeter to measure the volts and amps. Use the voltmeter to set the values, not the display on the power supply. You would then plot a graph of Voltage against Current, where Current is the y axis. In this configuration, you can determine if a component is ohmic if the line of best fit has a constant gradient. ==Mention the meaning of going through origin
- 2ci ==1/1
	- A material with zero resistance
- 2cii ==1/1
	- The critical temperature is the temp at which a material will begin to superconduct
- 2ciii ==1/1
	- Maglev trains

Current is defined as the rate of flow of charge. It is measured with an ammeter, which is connected in series, and ideally has zero resistance so it doesn't reduce the current while measuring.
Voltage (pd) is defined as the work done per unit charge, and is measured with a voltmeter. This is connected in parallel over a component, and ideally has infinite resistance so no current can flow through it whilst measuring.
Ohm's law is that the current through a component
