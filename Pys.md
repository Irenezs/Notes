Stress ($\sigma$) is defined as the force per unit cross-sectional area, with a unit of $Nm^{-2}$, or $Pa$. Strain is defined as a measure of the extension versus the initial length of the object. It has no units. To find stress, you can use a micrometer and some known masses. You use the micrometer at several points along the object, average them, then calculate the area using the formula (for a wire) $A=\pi r^2$ (As the micrometer finds the diameter, you must half the values you get from it). To measure the force you can string the wire up to a cieling then load the masses on and off to vary the force
