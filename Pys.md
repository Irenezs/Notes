Stress ($\sigma$) is defined as the force per unit cross-sectional area, with a unit of $Nm^{-2}$, or $Pa$. Strain is defined as a measure of the extension versus the initial length of the object. It has no units. To find stress, you can use a micrometer and some known masses. You use the micrometer at several points along the object, average them, then calculate the area using the formula (for a wire) $A=\pi r^2$ (As the micrometer finds the diameter, you must half the values you get from it). To measure the force you can string the wire up to a ceiling then load the masses on and off to vary the force applied to the wire. To find the strain on a wire you need the initial length, which can be found using a ruler, and the extension for some force applied, which can be found by marking a point on the wire and comparing it with a point of reference.

To find the YM of the material, you can plot a stress-strain graph with stress being the y and strain being the x. By doing this, there should be a straight section of the line of best fit. The gradient of this line is the YM. The reason you can only do this on the straight section is because afterwards the limit of proportionality is broken.

Stiffness - You need to expend more force to extend it therefore causing a greater gradient.
Strength - Can take more force before breaking, therefore it will have a higher peak on the graph.
Brittle - The material snaps without bending or stretching, therefore it will have a shorter section beyond the linear section of the graph.
Ductile - Stretches easily without breaking, can be made into wires, therefore it will have a longer section beyond the linear section of the graph.

 Limit of Proportionality - The limit to which when passed the material will no longer conform to Hooke's Law.
 Elastic Limit - The limit to which when passed the material will never go back to its original length.
 Plastic Behaviour - A material beyond its elastic limit.
 Yield Point - The point at which the stress in a wire will suddenly drop with increased strain.
 Necking - Where the cross-sectional area of a material gets thinner as a force is applied.
Ultimate Tensile Strength - The tensile stress needed to break a material.
Breaking Stress - A synonym for UTS.

A Brittle Material is one that breaks before it can plastically deform.
Examples are: Ceramic, Glass, Wood.
A ductile material is one that can be stretched thinly into wires without breaking.
Examples are: Copper, Steel, Paper.

As stress increases strain increases linearly until it passes the limit of proportionality, then the elastic limit, then the yield point. Necking reduces the area therefore increasing stress. A small increase in
