	- In Paper
- 31aii ==1/1
	- Reverse the connection to the power supply
- 31bi ==2/2
	- Plot a graph of voltages and current values, then divide V by I from the graph. Take multiple readings from the graph to see how R varies.
- 31bii ==1/1
	- It would decrease.
- 20a ==1/1
	- A component with constant resistance
- 2bi ==2/2
	- In Paper
- 2bii ==5/6
	- Use a variable power supply to change the voltage, use a voltmeter and ammeter to measure the volts and amps. Use the voltmeter to set the values, not the display on the power supply. You would then plot a graph of Voltage against Current, where Current is the y axis. In this configuration, you can determine if a component is ohmic if the line of best fit has a constant gradient. ==Mention the meaning of going through origin
- 2ci ==1/1
	- A material with zero resistance
- 2cii ==1/1
	- The critical temperature is the temp at which a material will begin to superconduct
- 2ciii ==1/1
	- Maglev trains

Current is defined as the rate of flow of charge. It is measured with an ammeter, which is connected in series, and ideally has zero resistance so it doesn't reduce the current while measuring.
Voltage (pd) is defined as the work done per unit charge, and is measured with a voltmeter. This is connected in parallel over a component, and ideally has infinite resistance so no current can flow through it whilst measuring.
Ohm's law is that the current through a component is directly proportional to the pd across it, provided the temperature doesn't change.
The IV graphs are depicted in the book. 
Resistor - The current is directly proportional to voltage, and is true even if battery reversed
Filament - The current increases with temperature until the temperature rises, which increases internal resistance in the wire. This is true if you swap the battery.
Diode - The current increases as the voltage increases, however no current flows if the battery is reversed.

Length - As L$\uparrow$, the R$\uparrow$, as the electrons travel further they are more likely to collide with the +ve ions.
Area - As A$\uparrow$, the R$\downarrow$. This is as more electrons can travel down the wire per second for a static voltage.
Temperature - As T$\uparrow$, R$\uparrow$. This is as the +ve ions are vibrating more vigorously, and so are more likely to collide with them.
Material - If the spacing of the +ve ions is different, the resistance will be different.

To find the resistivity of a wire, you can use a micrometer to measure and average several points on the wire to find the diameter, then calculate the area. Use crocodile clips and a ruler to vary the length of the wire. Use a voltmeter and ammeter to find the resistance for each length. Plot this as a graph, and the gradient will be $\frac{\rho}{A}$, so $\rho = gradient \times A$.
