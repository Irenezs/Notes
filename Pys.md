- 1 ==9==
	- a ==3==
		- A solid is made up of a regular arrangement of atoms with strong bonds between each atom and each atom vibrates on a fixed point.
	- b ==3==
		- A liquid is made up of a more disordered arrangement of atoms with a weaker set of bonds between atoms, and atoms gain translational energy.
	- c ==3==
		- A gas is made up of randomly moving particles with virtually no forces between the particles unless during collisions. The atoms of a gas move at high speeds in random directions
- 2 ==2==
	- The motion of the gas will increase in speed, as when energy is added to the system, the mean kinetic energy increases. ==The atoms still have a random motion==

	- a ==1==
		- The internal energy of a substance is the sum of the random distribution of kinetic and potential energies of the particles.
	- b ==3==
		- There is an increase in the mean kinetic energy of the aluminium atoms as the temperature rises, the potential energy does not change because the mean separation of the atoms does not change. Therefore the internal energy increases as kinetic energy increases.
	- c
		- As the metal melts, the average separation between the particles increases. Thus, the le
