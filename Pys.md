There are several properties all waves have: Diffraction, Interference, Refraction, Reflection, Transfer of Energy. All wave types can do the above five properties. A longitudinal wave has oscillations parallel to direction of energy transfer, while transverse waves have oscillations perpendicular to direction of energy transfer. Polarisation is a property only transverse waves have, when transverse waves enter a polarising filter, the oscillations of the waves become set to a single plane.

While the second polariser is rotating, it will be brightest at 0,180,360 degrees and dark at 90 and 270 degrees. This property can only be observed by transverse waves because the oscillations of a longitudinal wave are parallel to the direction of energy transfer.
