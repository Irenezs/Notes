6.2 Q4
	As there is a range of kinetic energies, there must be something else taking the rest of the energy away, as due to the conservation of energy all of the input energy must be conserved, and so there must be some particle taking away that excess energy, which was called a neutrino.

	Ionisation is where an atom loses one or more electrons.
6.5 Q3
	Between 0fm and 0.5fm, the strong nuclear force repels nucleons, where the closer they are the stronger the repelling force. From 0.5fm the strong interaction attracts nucleons. It has a range of around 2-3fm.
