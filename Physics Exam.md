		Hooke's law is that the extension of a spring is directly proportional to the force applied, provided the limit of proportionality is not reached.

			1. Start with the smallest mass. Measure the new length.
			2. Record the mass and new length-initial length.
			3. Repeat for all masses.
			4. Graph the mass against extension.
			5. Draw a line of best fit.
			6. Find the extension due to the rock sample.
			7. Use the line of best fit to find the mass corresponding to the extension of the rock sample.
		ii.
			Use a clamp to secure the stand to the table, this provides an opposite moment to the weights on the stand.

	a.
		The string is fixed on both ends, meaning that the wave will reflect off of the nodes (stationary points). The progressive waves caused by the pluck will therefore interfere with each other, and will undergo constructive interference as they have the same frequency.
