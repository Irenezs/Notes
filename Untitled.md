		- a
			- As most of the alpha particles pass straight through the foil, Rutherford deduced most of the atomic mass is contained in a small nuclei.
		- b
			- As a small fraction of alpha particles were deflected through large angles, he concluded that the nucleus is small and positively charged.

		- a
			- The container must be evacuated to reduce energy loss due to collisions
		- b
			- Foil must be very thin to reduce chance that alpha particles are deflected more than once.
		- c
			- The alpha particles must all have the same speed otherwise the slower particles would be deflected more.
		- d
			- The alpha particle beam must be narrow to allow for the angle of deflection to be measured accurately.

		- b
			- i
				- As the alpha particle moves closer to the nucleus the kinetic energy will decrease until it becomes a minimum when it is closest to the nucleus.
			- ii
				- The potential energy of the alpha particle is small when it is a long distance away from the nucleus. Potential energy rises to a maximum when closest to the nucleus.

		- a
			- Assuming alpha particles are only scattered once, and 1 in 10000 atoms are scattered on a single layer of atoms.
			- Thus if there are n layers, there are 1 in 10000n chance of being deflected by an atom
		- b
			- $\frac{1}{10000n}=\frac{A_n}{A_a}$
			- $\frac{1}{10000n}=\frac{\frac{\pi}{4}d_n^2}{\frac{\pi}{4}d_a^2}$
			- $\frac{1}{10000n}=\frac{d_n^2}{d_a^2}$
			- $n=\frac{\text{Thickness of foil}}{\text{Thickness of atom}}=\frac{10\times10^{-6}}{0.5\times10^{-9}}=20000$
			- $\frac{d_a^2}{2\times10^8}=d_n^2$
			- $d_n=\sqrt{\frac{(0.5\times10^{-9})^2}{2\times10^8}}$
			- $d_n=4\times10^{-14}\text{m}$
		- c
			- $r=\frac{Q_1Q_2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0E_k}$
			- $r=\frac{2\times79\times e^2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0\times8.0\times10^{-13}}$
			- $r=4.6\times10^{-14}$

			- Beta
		- b
			- Place an electric field around the source and measure the deflection. This will tell you the polarity of the charge, which can verify if alpha or beta.

		- a
			- As the beta particles hit the photographic plate, they cause a chemical reaction in the plate which turns the plate black. The beta particles are blocked by the key so a mask of the key is produced.
