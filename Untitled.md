			- In internal energy, no change in constituents of the nuclei, in $\beta^-$ decay, there is a change, $n\mapsto p$.

			- In internal energy, only an $e^-$ is released, while in $\beta^-$ decay, an $e^-$ and an $\overline{\nu_e}$.

			- In internal energy, loss of orbital $e^-$, while in $\beta^-$ decay, no change in orbital shells.
