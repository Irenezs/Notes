Geostationary orbits have orbital periods of 24 hours, meaning it has the same position relative to the earth's surface. A low polar orbit has an orbit of a couple hours. Geostationary orbits are much higher, and move at higher speeds.

Geostationary orbits are used for communications, satellite TV, etc. This is due to the fact ground dishes can be pointed at a single point in the sky and remain in coverage. Polar orbits are used for weather observations, GPS, etc. This is as they cover the entire surface of the Earth as they orbit.

$$F=\frac{GMm}{r^2}=m\omega^2r,\mspace{0.3em}\text{where}\mspace{0.3em}\omega=\frac{2\pi}{T}$$
$$\frac{GM}{r^3}=\frac{4\pi^2}$$
