		- $\beta^- \text{decay} : n \rightarrow p + \beta^- + \overline{\nu_e}$
		- proton number increases by one.
	- 3
		- There is missing energy which is carried off by a third particle, as conservation of energy must be conserved.
	- 4
		- It must be an electron antineutrino to conserve lepton number. An electron antineutrino has opposite signs to an electron.

		- The proton collides with electrons in the water in a proces called annihilation where two photons are produced that travel in opposite directions

		- The positron as it is charged, while $\overline{\nu}_e$ is neutral.
		- The antineutrino only interracts via the weak force, the lowest ranged force.
