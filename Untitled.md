		- a
			- Ionising radiation is dangerous as it can destroy cell membranes, or cause cancer by damaging DNA.
		- b
			- Film badges measure a person's exposure to ionising radiation. the filters allow different types of radiation through, if any detect a dose, it means the worker was exposed to radiation.

		- a
			- Radioactive sources should be kept in a lead-lined box when not in use as the lead will reduce the emissions to background levels. Keep sources away from each other, keep user as far away from the source.
		- b
			- Follow rules set out in 3a, follow local regulations

		- a
			- Common radioactive sources: air, medical, ground+buildings, food and drink, cosmic rays, etc.
		- b
			- cosmic rays may affect air crew more than the average profession. radiotherapists would be constantly getting contamination from working the machines.
		- c
			- Radon leakage is a serious health issue as it is an alpha emitter, if breathed in, the alpha particles will easily ionise the softer interior tissue.
