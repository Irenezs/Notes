			- In internal energy, no change in constituents of the nuclei, in $\beta^-$ decay, there is a change, $n\mapsto p$.
		- 2
			- In internal energy, only an $e^-$ is released, while in $\beta^-$ decay, an $e^-$ and an $\overline{\nu_e}$.

			- In internal energy, loss of orbital $e^-$, while in $\beta^-$ decay, no change in orbital shells.

		- Light may change direction if the optical density changes, however a change of only a few per cent is unlikely to be significant.

			- As the light travels more of the windscreen, it is more likely to detect water droplets., so more sensitive.
		- 2
			- Any curvature in the windscreen affects the light more, so will become less sensitive.
