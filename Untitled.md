- Coulomb's law states that the electrostatic force a charged particle experiences is inversely proportional to the square of the separation, where like charges produce a repulsive force and opposite charges produce an attractive force.
- Electric filed lines show the direction a positive charge will experience a force, with their density showing the electric field strength.
- Electric field strength is the force per unit charge of a field. The strength is constant in a uniform field but decreases with distance in a radial field.
- Electric potential is the work done per unit charge to bring a test charge from infinity to that point, where the potential at infinity is defined as 0. Potentials are negative for attractive forces, as it takes no external energy to move from infinity to that point.
- Equipotentials are lines where the change in potential is 0 when moving between two points on the line.
