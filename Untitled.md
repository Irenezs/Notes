		- $\beta^- \text{decay} : n \rightarrow p + \beta^- + \overline{\nu_e}$
		- proton number increases by one.

		- There is missing energy which is carried off by a third particle, as conservation of energy must be conserved.

		- It must be an electron antineutrino to conserve lepton number. An electron antineutrino has opposite signs to an electron.

		- The proton collides with electrons in the water in a proces called annihilation where two photons are produced that travel in opposite directions

		- The positron as it is charged, while $\overline{\nu}_e$ is neutral.
		- The antineutrino only interracts via the weak force, the lowest ranged force.

		- Q will have a larger volume, thus will experience a greater resistive force for any given speed, therefore Q will experience a greater deceleration.

		- The propeller acts on the water, which produces an equal force on the propeller from the opposite direction, as stated in Newton's third law.
		- The force on the ship equals the drag force on the ship, as the ship is at constant velocity and an object will continue at a velocity if it is not acted on by any external forces, due to Newton's first law.

		- When the system is enabled, drag decreases by more than the thrust. To maintain constant momentum then drag must equal thrust.
