Connect power supply to the oscilloscope and turn time base off, adjust the x and y until trace is visible, the trace will be a vertical line.

Increasing the volts per division will mean each division is worth a higher value of volts so traces will appear smaller.
Measure the length of the trace, half this value and then multiply by the volts per division to find the peak voltage. Divide this by root two to find the rms voltage. This is compared to 12V, the closer it is to 12 the more accurate the value.

Increasing the timebase setting will mean the timer per division will increase so the wavelength will decrease.
The time base setting should be turned on to produce a wave. measure the length to find timer period. Time base should be adjusted until
