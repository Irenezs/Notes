		- The permittivity of the dielectric is 6 times the permittivity of free space

		- The polar molecules align with the positive side facing the negative plate, producing a countering electric fiel, thus the pd reduces between the plates but the charge remains the same, therefore capacitance increases, as $C=\frac{Q}{V}$
