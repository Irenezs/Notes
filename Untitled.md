		- a
			- As most of the alpha particles pass straight through the foil, Rutherford deduced most of the atomic mass is contained in a small nuclei.
		- b
			- As a small fraction of alpha particles were deflected through large angles, he concluded that the nucleus is small and positively charged.

		- a
			- The container must be evacuated to reduce energy loss due to collisions
		- b
			- Foil must be very thin to reduce chance that alpha particles are deflected more than once.
		- c
			- The alpha particles must all have the same speed otherwise the slower particles would be deflected more.
		- d
			- The alpha particle beam must be narrow to allow for the angle of deflection to be measured accurately.
