# Monday

Solid
	Packed in a regular pattern
	Vibrate about a fixed point
	Strong bonds with all neighbours
Liquid
	Closely packed with no pattern
	Vibrate and can move past neighbours
	Bonds with neighbours
Gas
	Spread out with large gaps between them
	Moving quickly in random directions
	No bonds between atoms

Brownian Motion
	Smoke particles were observed through a microscope
	Moving randomly and unpredictably
	The smoke was colliding with air
	Proving the existence of molecules and atoms

- See Paper for diagram / Bullet 1
- The change is temperature is needed, so the thermometer can measure the initial value and each subsequent value. The voltmeter and ammeter can be used to find power, assuming all the power produced is being used to heat the oil. The stopwatch measures time, another required component for power.
- Energy transferred is calculated by $\Delta Q = \frac{P}{\Delta t} = VIt$.
- The mass of the liquid can be measured using a measuring scale.
- The specific heat capacity can be calculated by plotting a graph of $\Delta Q$ against $\Delta \theta$, drawing a line of best fit, and finding the gradient (grad = $mc$).
