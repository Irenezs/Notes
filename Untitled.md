# Wednesday ==6/6==

 - $A\mapsto B$
	 - Work is done by the trampoline on the gymnast against gravity
	 - The gymnast will gain GPE and lose KE
	 - Some energy is lost to sound / heat
	 - The trampoline loses EPE
- $B\mapsto A$
	- The gymnast will gain KE and lose GPE
	- Some energy is given out as sound / heat
	- The trampoline gains EPE

To reach a height above B, energy needs to be added to the system
