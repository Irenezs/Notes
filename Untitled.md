		- $V_1$ Passes over part A, a thin metal filament. This leads to thermionic emission, meaning electrons gain enough kinetic energy to leave the wire. $V_1$ does not need to be a high voltage, only around 6V. These electrons are accelerated towards part B, an anode with a hole in the centre, so that the electrons will pass through the anode to the target.
		- $V_2$ passes over the anode and the wire behind the electrons. $V_2$ is a large supply, measured in kV, meaning it generates an electric field towards the filament, so electrons fly toward the anode.

		- The de Broglie hypothesis states $\lambda\propto\frac{1}{p}$. As $p=\sqrt{2meV}$, $V_2$ is linked to the wavelength of the electrons. The ring diameter is related to wavelength by the fringe spacing equation. There is a change in ring diameter due to a change in $V_2$, which is consistent with de Broglie's hypothesis.

		- Maxwell's model predicts that light is a series of oscillating E and B fields propagating through space. Oscillating current in T provides an oscillating E field, leading to oscillating perpendicular B fields. These B fields will produce a varying emf in the loop

	- The semi-silvered glass block splits the beam into two, The plane block ensures both beams pass through the same thickness of glass and air. Beams combine back at the telescope with a path difference, therefore the observer will see an interference pattern from the beams.
	- The expected result was that the pattern would shift when the apparatus was rotated 90 degrees as the speed of light was presumed different depending on motion of the apparatus, therefore ether exists.
	- The actual result was no shift in the pattern, therefore no evidence of ether, and the speed of light is invariant.
