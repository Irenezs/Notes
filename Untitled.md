		- If the aerial is rotated in a vertical plane, there will be a changing in the intensity of microwaves detected. There will be a maximum when aerial is vertical, and a minimum when aerial is horizontal. Maximum is the plane of polarisation of the microwaves.

		- The observed signal will go through a series of maxima and minima, this is because the reflected and direct microwaves interfere. The path difference increases as the plate moves.

		- The angle of incidence on the core-cladding boundary decreases, so is now less than the critical angle.

		- A centripetal force acts inwards towards O, and there will be a reaction force from the ship's floor on the astronaut, which will mimic gravity.

		- The gradient is the acceleration of the ball, the area under the graph is the vertical distance travelled. Without air resistance, the gradient is constant negative, =g, and the area under the graph is 0 as the ball starts and finishes on the ground, reaching a higher height as area above time axis is greater. With air resistance, there is initially a steep gradient as air resistance in same direction as weight, and the total area under graph is 0, while air resistance causes the max height to be smaller.
