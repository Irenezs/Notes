		- Classical Wave Model
			- Wave model predicts an increase in the photocurrent, as the energy transferred into each electron increases with time.
		- Photon Model
			- The photon model predicts no change in the photocurrent, as the energy of a photon depends on frequency not intensity

		- $PM_2$ lies in the direction of earth's velocity, speed of light was predicted to be different in both directions. Thus time taken on path to $M_2$ is greater. Rotating the apparatus through 90 degrees would cause the time difference to change, causing a different interference pattern.
		- The apparatus has a resolution of 0.05 fringe spacings
		- Rgew experiment showed that there is no absolute motion, ether did not exist so light travels without a medium.
