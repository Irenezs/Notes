# Monday

Solid
	Packed in a regular pattern
	Vibrate about a fixed point
	Strong bonds with all neighbours
Liquid
	Closely packed with no pattern
	Vibrate and can move past neighbours
	Bonds with neighbours
Gas
	Spread out with large gaps between them
	Moving quickly in random directions
	No bonds between atoms

Brownian Motion
	Smoke particles were observed through a microscope
	Moving randomly and unpredictably
	The smoke was colliding with air
	Proving the existence of molecules and atoms
