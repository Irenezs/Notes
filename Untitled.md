		- Newton's used corpuscles, Huygen's used waves.
		- Newton's required light to speed up in a substance, Huygen's required it to slow down
	- 2
		- ![[Untitled Diagram.svg]]
		- Newton believed the corpuscles were attracted into the substance, so the speed perpendicular to the substance, $v_\perp$, increases, but the speed parallel to the substance, $v_\parallel$ remained the same, so the net result was a bend toward the normal.

		- Bright maxima separated by dark minima, this is caused by the superposing of waves, interfering constructively at maxima and destructively at minima. As this requires superposition, newton's corpuscles could not explain this effect of light.

		- a
			- Newton's other theories were very successful, so he was believed to be the better scientist.
		- b
			- Huygen's theory could not explain sharp shadows, they would expect diffraction but did not appreciate that may not be observed due to the very small wavelength, which was not known at the time.

		- An electromagnetic wave is perpendicular oscillating magnetic and electric fields in phase, which cause each other.

		- The speed of light is invariant, and depends on the constants for electric and magnetic fields.

			- He set up a transmitter, a reciever, and a metal plate like so:

			- Radiowaves travel towards the metal reflector and reflect back, superposing on the waves
