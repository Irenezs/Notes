		- As the electrons move through the filament, they collide with atoms inside of the filament, causing a change in momentum which is expressed as heat. As the atoms heat up, they will vibrate more strongly, which will increase the likely-hood they are struck by moving electrons, which will generate more heat, slowing the flow of charge down. This means resistance increases, meaning more voltage is needed for a higher current flow.

		- If the mass is increased, the friction on the wheels will increase, which will decrease the maximum range of the wheelchair.
		- If the speed is increased, the range is decreased as the air resistance will increase
