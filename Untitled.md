			- interference fringes formed where light from the two slits superposes. Bright fringes are formed where light interferes constructively, conversely, dark fringes are formed where light interferes destructively.
		- iii
			- In Paper
	- b
		- The central fringe would be white, where the side fringes would be a continuous spectra with blue being closest to the centre.
- 28
	- a
		- Light emitted is of the same wavelength, frequency, amplitude and has a constant phase relationship.
	- b
		- In Paper
	- c
		- A maximum is observed, as when two coherent sources interfere with a path difference of a whole number of wavelengths, they interfere constructively.
	- d
		- In Paper
