Connect power supply to the oscilloscope and turn time base off, adjust the x and y until trace is visible, the trace will be a verticle line.
Increasing the volts per division will mean each division is workth a higher value of volts so traces will appear smaller

Measure the length of the trace, half this value and then multiply by the volts per division to find the peak voltage. Divide this by root two to find the rms voltage. This is comared to 12V, the closer it is to 12 the more accurate the value
