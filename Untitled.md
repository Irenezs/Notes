		- A maximum is observed, as when two coherent sources interfere with a path difference of a whole number of wavelengths, they interfere constructively.

- The setup requires a laser, pointed at a screen perpendicularly through a diffraction grating. You also need a meter ruler.
- You need to find the number of fringes and the corresponding angle from n=0. You need to be given the slit seperation.
- $d\sin{\theta}=n\lambda \implies \lambda=\frac{d}{n}\sin{\theta}$. 
- The accuracy can be improved by calculating a mean value of $\sin{\theta}$ for each n and plotting n against $\sin{\theta}$, plotting a line of best fit, where gradient is $\frac{\lambda}{d}$.
