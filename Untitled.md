## Gravitational Field
When a charged particle enters a gravitational field it will move in a parabola given it enters perpendicular to the field, moving down a field line, accelerating down the line.

## Electric Field
When a +ve charge enters a field it will move in a parabola given it enters perpendicular to the field, moving down a field line, and accelerating down the line.

## Magnetic Field
When a charged particle enters a field it will move in a circle, given it enters perpendicular to the field, in one direction if +ve, the other if -ve.

## Cyclotron
A cyclotron has two D shaped electrodes inside a perpendicular magnetic field with a gap between them. The dees are connected to an alternating current.
The particles will move with circular motion whilst inside the dee and then accelerate across the gap (because the dees create an oscillating electric field due to the ac. Thus the frequency of ac needs to match the motion of the particle.) and enter the other dee at a higher speed, so would move in a larger circle, as $r\propto v$.

$$r=\frac{mv}{BQ}\mspace{2em}T=\frac{2\pi m}{BQ}$$
