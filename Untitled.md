		- The tesla is a measure of the magnetic flux density that produces a force of 1 unit force in a wire of length 1 unit length with 1 unit current flowing perpendicular to the field.

		- The force due to a magnetic field is perpendicular to the direction of the field AND the direction of velocity of the particle, so the force can never change the magnitude of velocity in the Ds.

		- The lines are closer so the field is stronger, meaning the material at K has a higher density
	- 3
		- The ball will speed up when moving towards K as the potential is lower at K.
