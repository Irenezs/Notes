- When connected to a power source, charging, the cell pushes electrons onto one plate, and pulls them from the other, charging both with -ve and +ve charge respectively. This causes a potential difference across the plates.
- When disconnected and discharging through a resistance, the current, charge, and voltage decrease exponentially over time as the electrons flow from the plate to the other side. The time taken to discharge depends on the time constant
