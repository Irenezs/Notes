- The ground state of an atom is the lowest and most stable energy level an atom can occupy.
- Excitation is where an orbital electron is given a discrete amount of energy to raise to a higher (excited) energy level. It can occur from collision from another electron or by absorbing a photon.
- When electrons move to a lower energy level, they release a photon that has energy equal to the difference in energy level. Photons therefore can have several discrete energies when being released from a specific atom. Therefore several wavelengths of photon are released, which is line spectra.
- In a fluorescent tube a current is passed over a gas in the tube, which will excite the atoms in the gas. When these gas atoms move to a lower state, they release photons of UV wavelengths, which are absorbed by the white coating on the tubes, which subsequently gets excited and releases photons when descending in energy level, of Visible light.

# Thursday

Excitation - Where an electron moves to a higher energy state
De-excitation - Where an electron moves to a lower energy state, releasing a photon
Ground State - The lowest energy state, most stable
Ionisation - When an electron is completely removed from an atom
Ionisation Energy - The energy required to completely remove an electron from an atom

An electron can be excited by a collision or absorbing a photon
