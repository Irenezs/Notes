		- To mitigate parallax error. This is done by lining up the pointer with its reflection, ensuring the meter is read properly.

		- The student should fully discharge the capacitor through the voltmeter in the 15V mode, then change the output pd of X to less than 3V, then adjust till the meter reads 3V.
		- she should take multiple readings of $T_\frac{1}{2}$, then reject anomalous results and take an average, plus correct for any zero error.
		- Theory is correct if the time constant is about 20% of the value using the 15V range.

		- V is recorded to the nearest volt as there is low scale markings on the meter
		- more lover values of V as to make the intervals in time about the same.
