			- As most of the alpha particles pass straight through the foil, Rutherford deduced most of the atomic mass is contained in a small nuclei.
		- b
			- As a small fraction of alpha particles were deflected through large angles, he concluded that the nucleus is small and positively charged.

		- b
			- Foil must be very thin to reduce chance that alpha particles are deflected more than once.
