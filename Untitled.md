- The ground state of an atom is the lowest and most stable energy level an atom can occupy.
- Excitation is where an orbital electron is given a discrete amount of energy to raise to a higher (excited) energy level. It can occur from collision from another electron or by absorbing a photon.
- When electrons move to a lower energy level, they release a photon that has energy equal to the difference in energy level.
