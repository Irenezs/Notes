		- $V_1$ Passes over part A, a thin metal filament. This leads to thermionic emission, meaning electrons gain enough kinetic energy to leave the wire. $V_1$ does not need to be a high voltage, only around 6V. These electrons are accelerated towards part B, an anode with a hole in the centre, so that the electrons will pass through the anode to the target.
		- $V_2$ passes over the anode and the wire behind the electrons. $V_2$ is a large supply, measured in kV, meaning it generates an electric field towards the filament, so electrons fly toward the anode.

		- The de Broglie hypothesis states $\lambda\propto\frac{1}{p}$. As $p=\sqrt{2meV}$, $V_2$ is linked to the wavelength of the electrons. The ring diameter is related to wavelength by the fringe spacing equation. There is a change in ring diameter due to a change in $V_2$, which is consistent with de Broglie's hypothesis.
