- Coulomb's law states that the electrostatic force a charged particle experiences is inversely proportional to the square of the separation, where like charges produce a repulsive force and opposite charges produce an attractive force.
- Electric filed lines show the direction a positive charge will experience a force, with their density showing the electric field strength.
- Electric field strength is the force per unit charge of a field. The strength is constant in a uniform field but decreases with distance in a radial field.
- Electric potential is the
