			- In internal energy, no change in constituents of the nuclei, in $\beta^-$ decay, there is a change, $n\mapsto p$.
		- 2
			- In internal energy, only an $e^-$ is released, while in $\beta^-$ decay, an $e^-$ and an $\overline{\nu_e}$.
		- 3
			- In internal energy, loss of orbital $e^-$, while in $\beta^-$ decay, no change in orbital shells.

		- Light may change direction if the optical density changes, however a change of only a few per cent is unlikely to be significant.

			- As the light travels more of the windscreen, it is more likely to detect water droplets., so more sensitive.
		- 2
			- Any curvature in the windscreen affects the light more, so will become less sensitive.

		- A large central bright fringes with smaller bright fringes on either side of lower intensity.
	- 2
		- The red filter creates a monochromatic light of a higher wavelength, meaning the fringes will increase in size.

		- The range of wavelengths will result in broader maxima, increasing in width increase as $\theta$ is increased.

		- The combined centre of mass of the wooden box + the beam will be directly over the pivot, so no moments are acting on the rope, so no tension is caused by the beam and box.

		- The projectile has an initial vertical component, so will take longer to hit the ground, so will increase range, however the horizontal component is no longer 18$ms^{-1}$, so will reduce range, so the total effect on the range is indeterminate without the angle released at.
