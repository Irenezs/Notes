		- The number of excess electrons on the droplet is 3, for each half to remain stationary the charge would need to be split equally, which is not possible as charge is quantised. Thus the student is wrong.

		- Corpuscular Theory:
			- Light is made up of corpuscles
			- Force acts attracting them to the water
			- Attraction only affects motion at the interface
			- Only one component of momentum changes at the interface
			- The vertical component of momentum increases, which causes the change in direction
		- Wave Theory:
			- Wave front is incident on the interface
			- The slowing down of the waves causes the change in direction
		- Acceptance:
			- Newton's theory required light to travel faster in water, while Huygen's required light to slow down. After measurement, Huygen's model was found to be correct.
			- Light was also shown to have interference properties that cannot be explained using corpuscles, therefore Huygen was proven right.
