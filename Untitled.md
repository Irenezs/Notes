	- $\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space, meaning how well free space allows electric fields to travel through
- 2
	- $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space, meaning how well free space allows magnetic fields to travel through
- 3
	- Oscillating magnetic and electric fields, each one inducing the other. Always perpendicular to each other.
