		-  Absolute zero can be understood as the temperature at which the average kinetic energy of the particles in a gas is 0. It can also be interpreted as the temperature where pV=0, via the ideal gas law (pV=nRT).

		- As they have the same temperature, they have the same mean kinetic energy.

		- Particles in the gas collide with the walls and change momentum, Equal and opposite force required in changing direction, due to newton's laws. As pressure = $\frac{F}{A}$, There is a pressure on the container walls.

		- $p\propto \frac{1}{V}$, $p\propto T$.
		- The volume can be increased, this increases the time between collisions with the container walls and as such reduces the rate of change of momentum, aka force.
		- The temperature can be decreased, which reduces the momentum change at the wall, as temperature is the kinetic energy of the particles, so the particles would move slower.
