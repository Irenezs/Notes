Both E and M exert a force on the spaceship in opposite directions, the force of attraction (weight) is much greater on E than M as it is more massive.

On the journey E to M, the resultant gravitational force is toward E before X and towards M after X, and vice versa for the return journey. The spaceship spends longer travelling in the opposite direction to the force for the outbound journey and longer travelling in the same direction as the gravitational force on the return. 

From E to M, the gravitational field strength of E gets weaker and gfe of M gets stronger, and at X these values are equal, so there is no resultant field strength.

The gravitational potential of E increases the further away the spacecraft becomes, at X the potential reaches a maximum before decreasing as M gets closer. To reach M from E, the spacecraft needs to generate enough energy to reach X, the opposite is true for getting to E from M. much more work is needed to move the craft from E to X than M to X, as a larger force is needed to overcome the larger distance.
