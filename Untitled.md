	- $\varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity of free space, meaning how well free space allows electric fields to travel through
- 2
	- $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space, meaning how well free space allows magnetic fields to travel through
- 3
	- Oscillating magnetic and electric fields, each one inducing the other. Always perpendicular to each other.

	- $$c=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0\varepsilon_0}}$$

	- Passing an induced current over a very small gap to produce a spark, making an electric field, causing em waves.
- 2
	- Passing them through a coil of wire with a small gap, if an em wave passed through, there will be a spark in the gap.
