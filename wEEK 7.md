		- The momentum of the air will increase.
	- b
		- There is a rate of change of momentum so there is a force acting on the air, due to Newton's second law. The air then exerts a force of equal size and opposite direction on the engine, stated by Newton's third law.
	- c
		- In Paper
	- d
		- Momentum is a vector, meaning it has a direction. Due to the air changing direction, the momentum will change.
	- e
		- In Paper
	- f
		- In Paper
	- g
		- rate of intake of air decreases as the plane slows, as there is a smaller rate of change of momentum

		- Emitted waves will reflect off of the back wall, and superpose with the incoming waves, causing a stationary wave.
	- b
		- The chocolate only melts in those spots because that is where the antinodes of the microwaves will be, as antinodes are where amplitude is greatest, and thus energy is greatest.
	- c
		- In Paper
	- d
		- So that the positions of the antinodes can continually change during cooking.

		- stress/$\sigma$ : force exerted over cross-sectional area
		- strain/$\varepsilon$ : extension over original length
	- b
		- the material is stiff, which is shown on the graph by a steep gradient

		- For a cable in a lift, cable B will be best. This is due to its high breaking stress and young modulus. material A is not a choice because it would fail without warning.
		- For a cable in a bungee cord, cable D would be best. This is due to the fact it can store a large amount of energy before failiure. It could not be any of the other cables as they have a high young modulus, causing a sudden stop to extension, thus higher forces.

		- The resistors have a constant ratio, and thus the potential difference across AB is very small, as the resistance ratios in each arm is very similar.

	- a
		- The energy of a photon is linked to the frequency, and only when the energy of the photon is greater than the work function are electrons emitted from the plate.
	- b
		- Increasing intensity means more photons incident per second, which will make the current greater.
	- c-d
		- In Paper
	- e
		- The stopping potential would be greater, because the energy of the photons would be greater, thus the maximum kinetic energy would be greater.

	- a
		- An isotope is an atom with the same proton number but a different nucleon number.
	- b
		- The total momentum of the system must be conserved, and so the two photons must be formed to cancel each-other out.
