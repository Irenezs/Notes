	- a
		- The momentum of the air will increase.
	- b
		- There is a rate of change of momentum so there is a force acting on the air, due to Newton's second law. The air then exerts a force of equal size and opposite direction on the engine, stated by Newton's third law.
	- c
		- In Paper
	- d
		- Momentum is a vector, meaning it has a direction. Due to the air changing direction, the momentum will change.
	- e

	- g
		- rate of intake of air decreases as the plane slows, as there is a smaller rate of change of momentum

	- a
		- Emitted waves will reflect off of the back wall, and superpose with the incoming waves, causing a stationary wave.
	- b
		- The chocolate only melts in those spots because that is where the antinodes of the microwaves will be, as antinodes are where amplitude is greatest, and thus energy is greatest.
