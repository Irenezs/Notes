I am applying to this apprenticeship for many reasons, and am a good candidate for the position for the following reasons: First and foremost, I enjoy technology in all of its forms, diagnosing issues in my personal computer has always been a relatively fun task to me. This has lead to me being fairly adept at solving problems when they occur.

Relating to this, in my Computer Science A Level, there is a module wherein I must research, plan, develop, and analyse a complete computer program on anything we choose. By completing this module, I will develop needed skills for the workplace, such as identifying problems, analysing them, and proposing solutions to them. Outside of college, I consume a wide variety of media surrounding tech news and related topics, which develops a foundational understanding of the area surrounding the job. This will aid me in my duties at {insert business}, as by understanding what is going on around me, I can better create links and find solutions to problems in the workplace.

Going outside of the tech sphere, one of my hobbies is to play Dungeons and Dragons, which is a game that promotes a group of people to work together in a tight group. This will develop both my teamwork and my communication skills, which will most definitely help in the workplace.
