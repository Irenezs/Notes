		- Hadrons are made of quarks, and thus interact with any force, and are the only particle to interact with the strong force. There are two classes of hadron; mesons, made of a quark and antiquark; and baryons, made of 3 quarks. The only stable free baryon is the proton, which can be made from several decays, including from a neutron (beta-minus)

		- There is a force on the gas as the gas's momentum is changing, which requires a force, due to Newton 2. There is a deceleration as the resistive force is greater than the weight, therefore resultant force. acceleration will be in the same direction as resultant, due to Newton 2

		- More dust to displace, as more work done there will be a larger resultant force on the system therefore greater deceleration
