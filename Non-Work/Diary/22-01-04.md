Today is the start of this diary, I plan on documenting the things I do this year to hopefully keep myself honest. I hope to do something productive every day of this year, and this diary should hopefully keep this true. 

I have accomplished writing this diary today, only a small accomplishment; 2 paragraphs in all. However, if I do write a page every day it will become a bigger accomplishment. See you tomorrow.
