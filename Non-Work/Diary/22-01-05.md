Lots of things happened today, to start I took public busses to college, It took one and a half hours but it went by very quickly, which was nice. I also had a 3d printer delivered today, the Creality Ender 3 Neo, which came with instructions that took a good while to understand lmao. Hopefully tomorrow I can do a test print like the boat or toaster, see you then.
