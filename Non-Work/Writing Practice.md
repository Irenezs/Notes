Run. Do not look back. It will see you. Run. Hide. Quicker. Don't stop. Hide. Hide. Hide.

_How long have I been running?_ Years. Days. You have just begun. Forever.
_Will I stop?_ Never. It will find you. You must keep going. 
Run.
_Who am I?_ Does not matter. Run. Do not look back. Run.
_Where are-_ 

_I hit a wall._ It has always been like this. A cycle of running, pain, and fright. I must never stop running. What is it? I do not know. I cannot know, for that be where madness lie.

The forest is dark, midnight dark. Impossibly dark, yet I can see the path. Why can I see a path? What would happen if I strayed from the path? Maybe it is only following the same path as me? Fear, Betrayal. I must follow the path. it is the way. I cannot stay on the path, it will follow me. Anger, Fright.

I take a step off of the beaten yet overgrown trail. It hurts, I cannot breath. I cannot hide, I cannot run. It can see me. I need to follow the path. I cannot follow the path or it will find me. Suffocating. Run. Hide. Flee. You cannot stop. You must run. Run. Flee. Hide.
