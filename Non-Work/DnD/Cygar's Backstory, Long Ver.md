A busy street, full of market stalls, families and an all around sense of joy. There is a festive mood in Pexthiona's capital, and in one particular back-street, an important person is fleeing the castle guards.

"Have you seen this lady?"
"Where did she go!"

Chatter can be heard from the bustle, and our focus slinks further into the alley. 

"Hey, who are you?" A sweet voice catches the escapee in a moment of fright, where she takes a defensive position, before relaxing after looking upon the form in-front of her. A small child, around 7-8, most likely here for the festival. 

"You're telling me you don't recognise me?" Our troublemaker asks. "I'm Cygar Pexthia, the crown princess!"

"Oh wow! I've always wanted to meet a princess! My names is Frixfal"
