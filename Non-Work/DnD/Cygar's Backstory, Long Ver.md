# Chapter Introduction

A busy street, full of market stalls, families and an all around sense of joy. There is a festive mood in Pexthiona's capital, and in one particular back-street, an important person is fleeing the castle guards.

"Have you seen this lady?"
"Where did she go!"

Chatter can be heard from the bustle, and our focus slinks further into the alley. 

"Hey, who are you?" A sweet voice catches the escapee in a moment of fright, where she takes a defensive position, before relaxing after looking upon the form in-front of her. A small child, around 7-8, most likely here for the festival. 

"You're telling me you don't recognise me?" Our troublemaker asks. "I'm Cygar Pexthia, the crown princess!"

"Oh wow! I've always wanted to meet a princess! My names is Frixfal" She responds graciously, giving courtesy with the hem of her dress. 

Cygar smiles gingerly, before taking Frixfal's hand and dragging her further into the alley. "Quick, they're after me, follow me!", Cygar whispers in such a way that it is audible to Frixfal

"Its not like I have a choice." Frixfal responds with a smirk on her face, though it goes unnoticed by Cygar, focusing on remembering the map she had half a look at in the castle.

Cygar takes the girl to a small gap in the back wall, and tells Frixfal to enter the gap, to which she accepts, and both the girls enter the small cubby hole, enough room to hold about 3 people comfortably, with a makeshift table made of scraps from the area.

"So, why are you here? Is it for the festival" Cygar asks, after getting comfortable sitting cross-legged at the table.

"Yeah, of course! That's why everyone is here, dork." Frixfal replies, sitting down with less force and more caution. "How long will we be staying in here?"

"Oh, until they start looking in the suburbs, should only take about 20 minutes." Cygar responds quickly, as if she didn't hear the insult.

"Why are you running, today of all days? Surely you should be celebrating with the royal family."

"Because they make such a spectacle about it, you saw all the market stalls out there!"

"Its the crown princesses' birthday, I would hope they have a spectacle!"

"Its just annoying, though, I just wanna have fun, there's too much waving to be done as a royal..."

The two girls keep talking, losing track of time, it ends up being about 45 minutes before they leave the den.

# Chapter Market

"Okay, I think the coast is clear by now, what should we do in town?"

"I think I saw an entertainment corner with my parents when I was walking with them but I didn't have any money..."

"Well I can provide that!" Cygar pulls out about 5gp worth of coins, made of copper pieces and some silver pieces, and a single gold piece. The girls go to the market.

"Test your luck, dunk the man, gain a prize!"
"Test your strength, large prizes to those who strike the bell!"
"Test your dexterity, fill the balloon, win big!"
Announcers call out to the crowds, most paying no notice to them.

"Which do you wanna go on first?" Cygar asks, looking as if she had stars in her eyes.

"I wanna try them all! Lets do the dunking one!" Frixfal replies, just as eager as Cygar.

"Step right up! 5cp for 3 shots, 10cp for 7! Want to test your luck, young misses?" Cygar hands the attendee 5cp and takes a ball. She takes her hand back, and throws aimlessly, aiming more towards the man in the dunking tank rather than the target.

"Ooh, bad miss!" Angered, she takes another ball and tries a little more carefully, almost hitting the target, the man in the tank smirks.

"Another miss!"

"Here, let me try." Frixfal takes the remaining ball, and takes a deep breath, tests the weight of the ball and takes a deep breath, using her other arm as a guide line for the trajectory, and throws the ball with an amount of force Cygar didn't expect, but before she could say anything, the sound of splashing and a man, trying really hard not to curse in front of children, being very cold.
"I did it" Frixfal makes a peace sign with her fingers for a brief moment, before taking the prize for a bullseye, a trinket really, a small plush made with medium quality materials. Immediately after taking the prize, she turns to Cygar, "Here, its for you!"

Cygar, with a slight blush, accepts the teddy with a small thanks, not wanting to draw attention due to her prominence.

The two take turns on each of the machines, eventually tiring out, where Frixfal says "I need to return to my family, they must be worried sick, and so should you Cygar."

"Fiiiinnnnneeee, but we must play together again soon!"

Frixfal giggles, and agrees, before waving off and goes off to her families lodging.

Cygar sighs, and makes her way to the castle.

"Well go on, let me in" 

The gate attendants open the gate hurriedly, and tell her to go to the main chamber, her parents want her. Its only natural, she caused a lot of trouble today; the main show of the festival going missing, though its not like this was the first time this happened.

In the main chamber, the King hugs Cygar gently, as he usually does after these events. Her mother, however, gives her a snide look and Cygar heads to her room slightly angry, but overall satisfied with her day, going to sleep with the teddy in her arms.
