A busy street, full of market stalls, families and an all around sense of joy. There is a festive mood in Pexthiona's capital, and in one particular back-street, an important person is fleeing the castle guards.

"Have you seen this lady?"
"Where did she go!"

Chatter can be heard from the bustle, and our focus slinks further into the alley. 

"Hey, who are you?" A sweet voice catches the escapee in a moment of fright, where she takes a defensive position, before relaxing after looking upon the form in-front of her. A small child, around 7-8, most likely here for the festival. 

"You're telling me you don't recognise me?" Our troublemaker asks. "I'm Cygar Pexthia, the crown princess!"

"Oh wow! I've always wanted to meet a princess! My names is Frixfal" She responds graciously, giving courtesy with the hem of her dress. 

Cygar smiles gingerly, before taking Frixfal's hand and dragging her further into the alley. "Quick, they're after me, follow me!", Cygar whispers in such a way that it is audible to Frixfal

"Its not like I have a choice." Frixfal responds with a smirk on her face, though it goes unnoticed by Cygar, focusing on remembering the map she had half a look at in the castle.

Cygar takes the girl to a small gap in the back wall, and tells Frixfal to enter the gap, to which she accepts, and both the girls enter the small cubby hole, enough room to hold about 3 people comfortably, with a makeshift table made of scraps from the area.

"So, why are you here? Is it for the festival" Cygar asks, after getting comfortable sitting cross-legged at the table.

"Yeah, of course! That's why everyone is here, dork." Frixfal replies, sitting down with less force and more caution. "How long will we be staying in here?"

"Oh, until they start looking in the suburbs, should only take about 20 minutes." Cygar responds quickly, as if she didn't hear the insult.

"Why are you running, today of all days? Surely you should be celebrating with the royal family"
