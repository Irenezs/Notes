## Slayer of Braa'g Mauth

Dusk, 5 days out from the capital, in the courtyard of one of the greatest enemies to Pexthonia since the battle of Mon'kath, stood Cygar Pexthia, tossing an apple above her head.

"24 hours ago, a messenger arrived before you and warned of my arrival, you are stupid to have not run." Cygar postulated, "Around 12 hours ago I arrived at your compound, and I must admit I am impressed at your courage." She takes a bite of the apple. "Though perhaps what you see as courage I see as stupidity, because it took all of an hour for me to arrive at your throne room, Braa'g." The apple is sweet, and juicy, of impeccable quality. "And now it is time for me to end you, do you have anything to say?" She takes another bite of the apple.

"If you think just because you took out some henchmen around the perimeter wall means you're going to win against the great Braa'g Mauth, you are mistaken, you spoiled Princess" Braa'g muttered. "Very well, if you wish not to surrender, then I will take your life instead" She throws the apple towards the man sat upon a stolen throne, still with the Pexthian seal plastered atop the headpiece, and sends a bolt of lightning through the core of the apple hitting Braa'g Mauth in the forehead, killing Braa'g Mauth before he hit the ground.

"Now how do I get this home..."

## Sole User of Mechanica Fallus

Whirring, hammering, and a whole manner of arcane noises escape from the 4th Tower, inside is the workshop of Cygar Pexthia, the 3rd crown princess to Pexthonia, and Artificer known across the country (for her spectacular failiures). 

"Mistress Pexthia!" The doors slam open, a creature no more than a foot tall, sat atop a cloud floats into the workshop. "What, can't you see that I'm busy Cantyl?" The woman retorted snidely, "Is there something the matter?" The creature, now having floated into the light from the lantern overhead so as able to be seen in a good detail is clearly a patchworked humanoid, made of metal scraps and upon a detailed inspection it would be found that the skin is painted on. "Oh, nothing is wrong per se, but you do realise that its the middle of the night? The servants are getting restless."

"No matter, I am just about finished anyway" Cygar finishes up by tightening a bolt and speaking an incantation above the project on the table. The object looks like a normal leather armour with studded rivets for strength and several runes carved into the body, glowing blue, but clearly burning out. "Are you going to try it on, mistress?" Cantyl picks up the armour by the neck and holds it up ready for Cygar to slip it on, which she does.

"Incredible! It fits perfectly!" There is a large gemstone embedded into the gloves of the armour that is glowing, as if collecting energy. "Time to test it out!" Cygar raises her arm and points it out of the open window. "Firing in 3... 2... 1..." A loud click can be heard, to the magical construct Cantyl the flow of magic in the armour can be seen, but then nothing happens. "Huh? thats od-" A large explosion can be heard, parts of the armour are sent flying across the room and Cantyl is sent to the other side of the workshop. As the dust settles, Cygar is seen taking notes on a parchment sheet that was sent flying, and a large burn mark is seen on her left cheek.

"Mechanica Fallus. Its a good name don't you think!" Cygar looks unphased by the injury, and Cantyl doesn't have the heart to tell her
