# Sneak Attack
Beginning at 1st level, you know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack if you have [advantage](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Ability%20Scores?expansion=0#toc_2) on the attack roll. The attack must use a [finesse](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Weapons?expansion=0#toc_4) or a ranged weapon.  
  
You don't need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn't [incapacitated](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Conditions?expansion=0#toc_6), and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll.  
  
The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.

# Cunning Action
Starting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the [Dash](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=0#toc_23), [Disengage](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=0#toc_24), or [Hide](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Combat?expansion=0#toc_27) action.

# Fancy Footwork
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn how to land a strike and then slip away without reprisal. During your turn, if you make a melee attack against a creature, that creature can't make opportunity attacks against you for the rest of your turn.

# Rakish Audacity
Starting at 3rd level, your confidence propels you into battle. You can give yourself a bonus to your initiative rolls equal to your Charisma modifier.

You also gain an additional way to use your Sneak Attack; you don't need advantage on the attack roll to use your Sneak Attack against a creature if you are within 5 feet of it, no other creatures are within 5 feet of you, and you don't have disadvantage on the attack roll. All the other rules for Sneak Attack still apply to you.

# Uncanny Dodge
Starting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack's damage against you.
