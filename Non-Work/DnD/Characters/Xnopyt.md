### Fairy Magic
You know the [Druidcraft](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:druidcraft) cantrip. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the [Faerie Fire](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:faerie-fire) spell with this trait. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the [Enlarge/Reduce](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:enlarge-reduce) spell with this trait. Once you cast [Faerie Fire](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:faerie-fire) or [Enlarge/Reduce](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:enlarge-reduce) with this trait, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast either of those spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race).

### $1^{st}$ - Wild Magic Surge
Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Once per turn, the DM can have you roll a d20 immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. If you roll a 1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a magical effect. If that effect is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic, and if it normally requires concentration, it doesn't require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration.

### $1^{st}$ - Tides of Chaos
Starting at 1st level, you can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.

Any time before you regain the use of this feature, the DM can have you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. You then regain the use of this feature.

### $2^{nd}$ - Font of Magic
At 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within yourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which allow you to create a variety of magical effects.

- **Sorcery Points.** You have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer table. You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.
- **Flexible Casting.** You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points. You learn other ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels.
    - **_Creating Spell Slots._** You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The Creating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given level. You can create spell slots no higher in level than 5th. Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a long rest.
    - **_Converting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points._** As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of sorcery points equal to the slot's level.

### $3^{rd}$ - Metamagic
At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.

- **Careful Spell.** When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw against the spell.

- **Distant Spell.** When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell.
    - When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.

- **Empowered Spell.** When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.
    - You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

- **Extended Spell.** When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

- **Heightened Spell.** When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.

- **Quickened Spell.** When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting.

- **Seeking Spell.** If you make an attack roll for a spell and miss, you can spend 2 sorcerer points to reroll the d20, and you must use the new roll.
    - You can use Seeking Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

- **Seeking Spell (UA).** When you cast a spell that requires you to make a spell attack roll or that forces a target to make a Dexterity saving throw, you can spend 1 sorcery point to ignore the effects of half- and three-quarters cover against targets of the spell.

- **Subtle Spell.** When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal components.

- **Transmuted Spell.** When you cast a spell that deals a type of damage from the following list, you can spend 1 sorcery point to change that damage type to one of the other listed types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, thunder.

- **Twinned Spell.** When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spell's level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip). To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell's current level. For example, _[magic missile](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:magic-missile)_ and _[scorching ray](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:scorching-ray)_ aren't eligible, but _[ray of frost](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:ray-of-frost)_ and _[chromatic orb](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:chromatic-orb)_ are.

### $4^{th}$ - ABI (Feat : Telepathic)

You awaken the ability to mentally connect with others, granting you the following benefits:

WIS +1

- You can speak telepathically to any creature you can see within 60 feet of you. Your telepathic utterances are in a language you know, and the creature understands you only if it knows that language. Your communication doesn't give the creature the ability to respond to you telepathically.

- You can cast the [Detect Thoughts](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:detect-thoughts) spell, requiring no spell slot or components, and you must finish a long rest before you can cast it this way again. Your spellcasting ability for the spell is the ability increased by this feat. If you have spell slots of 2nd level or higher, you can cast this spell with them.

### $5^{th}$ - Magical Guidance

When you reach 5th level, you can tap into your inner wellspring of magic to try and conjure success from failure. When you make an ability check that fails, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll the d20, and you must use the new roll, potentially turning the failure into a success.

### $6^{th}$ - Bend Luck

Starting at 6th level, you have the ability to twist fate using your wild magic. When another creature you can see makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can use your reaction and spend 2 sorcery points to roll 1d4 and apply the number rolled as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the creature's roll. You can do so after the creature rolls but before any effects of the roll occur.
