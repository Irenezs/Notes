### Fairy Magic
You know the [Druidcraft](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:druidcraft) cantrip. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the [Faerie Fire](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:faerie-fire) spell with this trait. Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the [Enlarge/Reduce](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:enlarge-reduce) spell with this trait. Once you cast [Faerie Fire](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:faerie-fire) or [Enlarge/Reduce](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:enlarge-reduce) with this trait, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast either of those spells using any spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait (choose when you select this race).

### $1^{st}$ - Wild Magic Surge
Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Once per turn, the DM can have you roll a d20 immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. If you roll a 1, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table to create a magical effect. If that effect is a spell, it is too wild to be affected by your Metamagic, and if it normally requires concentration, it doesn't require concentration in this case; the spell lasts for its full duration.
### $1^{st}$ - Tides of Chaos
Starting at 1st level, you can manipulate the forces of chance and chaos to gain advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. Once you do so, you must finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.

Any time before you regain the use of this feature, the DM can have you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table immediately after you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher. You then regain the use of this feature.
### $2^{nd}$ - Font of Magic
