# Design
- Pre-write testing plans
	- Do not rush this, you will change ur design, u knob so

# Development
__Always have a testing table and testing evidence document open and enter details in every test
Write up testing as you do it to save hours later__
Explain what will be done each version
## Version 1
- Written as you are about to do it
- Justify what you will be doing to make a minimum working product
- Show code and explain what happened - written as a diary
- Testing Table of V1
	- Show failed tests
		- Show what happened and how you corrected it
	- Show successful tests
	- Test evidence can be done in an appendix
- Write an evaluation on this
	- New/dropped features, etc

## V2/V3
- Copy and paste V1 - do not repeat unnecessary tests
- What did you intend here, what are you actually going to do - refer to V1eval
- Justify, Show, Test, Eval

## Testing Table
Test no|Version|Test|Expected|Actual|Correction|Test Data|Justification
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
Obvious|Obvious|What the test is|Expected Result|Actual Result|What done to correct this|What data was used|Why this was necessary
