# Problem Identification
In the current gaming ecosphere, there is a lack of truly exceptional games that excel at all the points it tries to compete against. This has been achieved by some gems in the history of the hobby, however the problem plagues most games released in the current time. This is true for every genre, one of which I will focus on is the factory games; where you manage a factory, examples being Factorio or Shapez. In my opinion, all these games lack in some key areas. These areas are as follows:

## Focus
Some games ostensibly about factory management end up more about other factors added to the game, this does not detract from the game, but is not what I look for in a factory management game.

## Content
Most games in this genre seem to burn up very quickly, using all of their content then by the half-way point your only goal is to just make a bigger factory, rather than giving you new tools or puzzles.

## Content
Most games do not offer the ability to let users publish their own factories or levels, which will increase the game's lifespan as long as the community wants it to live.
