# Interviews
For this project, it will be important to ask the primary stakeholders their opinions on what to include and how to proceed with development, so as to produce the greatest product possible. On that point, I have drafted a set of questions that can give me pointers on how to proceed. These questions are below:
- What do you look for in games? 
- Do you play card games? 
	- Who do you play with?
	- How often would you say you play?
- Would you consider playing them online?
- What data would you like seeing about your games?
