		- The strong interaction is the cause of keeping together hadrons, it has a range of 3fm, and is repulsive below 0.5fm.
	- b
		- In alpha decay, nucleon number is unchanged, while in beta decay a neutron turns into a proton (contains nucleons) and 2 leptons (does not contribute to baryon number), so baryon number stays unchanged.

		- Strangeness is not conserved
	- e
		- Results must be independently confirmed, and many skills are necessary to prove a result.

		- The acceleration in Fig.1 is constant, while in Fig.2 the acceleration will change, starting at a greatest value and gradually decrease to 0.
	- c
		- The loss of GPE is the same, so the gain in KE will remain unchanged.
	- d
		- The rain initially only has vertical momentum, and so when the rain hits the truck, the rain's vertical momentum will decrease, and the truck's horizontal momentum will remain unchanged.
