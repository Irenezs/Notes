		- The strong interaction is the cause of keeping together hadrons, it has a range of 3fm, and is repulsive below 0.5fm.
	- b
		- In alpha decay, nucleon number is unchanged, while in beta decay a neutron turns into a proton (contains nucleons) and 2 leptons (does not contribute to baryon number), so baryon number stays unchanged.

		- Strangeness is not conserved
